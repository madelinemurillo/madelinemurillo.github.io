            Ulises Carrion mentions that in Mail Art, the mail is not the medium but the support, because it is just a convenient way to send the mail art out. The postal system can be substituted while other more significant elements like drawings, words, or paper cannot really be substituted in a piece of mail art. These more significant elements would be considered the media when it comes to mail art. The postal system would be considered to be a medium if the artist uses it in a way that plays an important role in the mail art itself. It was also interesting to think about how artists are free to create their mail art piece however they want but in regards to the mailing component, they lose this freedom as they have to abide by pre established rules and pay the calculated price no matter what their piece is. While reading, I was also wondering who the “Big Monster” could be. Big monster seems to be someone the artist feels that they have to prove themselves to. Maybe the artist knows that they have satisfied the “Big Monster” when they get a response back from someone who they sent their mail art to. Getting a response back may indicate that the person felt that the mail art was important enough to respond back to.
             <br><br>
            Questions:<br>
            1. What sub system (the Mail or the written language) do u think is more prevalent in the postal system in today’s day in age?<br>
            2. Who do you think the Big Monster is?<br>
            3. The reading mentions that the names that get sent mail art are “chosen with great care”, do you know how they select who to send their mail art to?<br>

            <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:21pt;">Week 3 - Laurel Schwulst & Édouard U - Selections from Creative Independent and Arena How Do You Use the Internet Mindfully</span><br><br>
            This reading offered an interesting perspective on what a website is. When I originally thought of what a website was, I immediately thought of what many modern shopping websites look like. I thought of how structured they are and how they carry various links and tabs in an easily accessible manner. This reading has expanded my perspective on what a website is and has allowed me to recognize that websites don’t always have to be conventional and that they can be very creative and artistic instead. The reading made me recognize that there are endless possibilities as to what a website is. It was also interesting how in the reading it mentioned that the creator of a website simultaneously plays the role of both the author and the architect and that through their website they can establish their own identity. My original perspective on websites was also challenged when the reading mentioned that websites should be “inherently unfinished” and that they are living and temporal spaces. I thought that perspective was interesting because it made me reflect on the websites that I interact with, and it made me recognize that they are indeed continuously evolving and improving with time. It also made me think about websites that I rarely interact with or have only interacted with once and that's when I realized that they tend to be websites that serve as an archive. This way of thinking that was offered by the reading motivates people to get the ball rolling and to start creating websites without putting the pressure on themselves to get it perfectly right on their first attempt. The reading also included a variety of metaphors for websites and one that really stood out to me was when a website was compared to a rock that is thrown into the ocean. This comparison suggests that when an idea arises you can go ahead and create a website and that you should not be afraid to throw as many websites into the “ocean” as you want.
             <br><br>
            Questions:<br>
            1. What do you think makes a website a successful one?<br>
            2. The reading argues that personal websites are more important than social media platforms. Do you agree with that?<br>
            <br>

            <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:21pt;">Week 4 - Olia Lialina - STILL THERE Ruins and Templates of Geocities from Lost and Living (in) Archives</span><br><br>
            This reading made me think about the digital world as we know it and how remnants of its past have disappeared but still continue to impact websites today. It was interesting to learn about Geocitites and how it in a way served as an earlier version of social media as people created their own home pages (personal websites). Parts of Geocities were able to be preserved and archived. They were even able to find a folder containing its backgrounds, navigation elements, and templates. They also try to look at the remains of the Geocities sites that were found and try to figure out what is missing and what elements could have existed in those deleted spaces. This makes me think about all of the updates that are constantly being made to recent devices, and it makes me wonder whether elements in current websites will eventually become inaccessible as well and whether that will happen at a faster rate now that updates occur very frequently. It was also interesting to find out that in order to keep distances between the elements on a page, early web designers had to use a clear image file (c.gif) that they would stretch in order to create that distance. Lialina also mentions that maybe c.gif hasn’t been deleted because it might be used in the layouts of other websites outside of Geocities. Therefore, deleting c.gif would end up affecting various parts of the web. This shows how remnants of the digital past may still be influencing the web as we know it today. This reading really made me think about whether the internet as we know it will all one day disappear.
            <br><br>
            Discussion Questions:<br>
            1. Do you think that there will come a point in time where all of the elements on websites in today’s day and age will disappear or become inaccessible?<br>
            2. If websites eventually get “destroyed,” then does that mean that everyone’s digital footprint will go with it too?<br>
           <br>

           <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:21pt;">Week 5 - David Reinfurt - Selections from A *New* Program for Graphic Design.pdf</span><br><br>
            Gestalt psychology has helped provide research on perception which has allowed us to understand how humans view and organize visual input into what they perceive as visual output. It's interesting how gestalt principles affect the way we view and perceive things. It can allow us to see multiple images and patterns at once. For instance, when looking at figure-ground relations in some images, you can perceive different things depending on whether your attention was drawn to the negative or positive spaces. The FedEx logo example of figure-ground and how it incorporates an arrow into it really caught me by surprise because I had never noticed the arrow in the logo before. I also really liked the example provided in the reading that mentions that there was a rectangular frame of individual light bulbs but what Wertheimer perceived was only one light moving around the frame when in reality those various individual light bulbs were actually just illuminating in sequence. This example really shows how we can also interpret a sense of movement when looking at something changing in sequence. It was really interesting to learn about the “waterfall effect” and how staring at something moving for a period of time, such as a waterfall, can make you think that you are seeing something else move when you move your gaze to something else. The article also argues that we perceive the world in “organized wholes,” not in parts. It was also interesting to learn about the 1960 presidential debate where JFK and Nixon couldn’t be in the same room due to scheduling conflicts so they had George Corrin design both sets and try to replicate the exact conditions of the environment for both locations in order to create the illusion that the two candidates were in the same room. The seamless look of the event really speaks to Corrin’s work as a designer and how much thought he put into it. This article really made me think about how I view the world and how my perceived reality may not always be the true reality.
            <br><br>
            Questions:<br>
            1. Do Gestalt principles affect the way animals view and perceive things too?<br>
            2. Do you think that people have become accustomed to the “waterfall effect” and do not experience it often or is it something that people don’t recognize that they are experiencing due to having trouble distinguishing real from apparent movement?<br>

            <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:21pt;">Week 6 - Alessandro Ludovico & Florian Cramer - Selections from Publishing from Post-Digital-Print</span><br><br>
            The author believes that print will also evolve as digitalization grows. They mention that they can envision print developing new processes like networked realtime distribution, remote printing, and on-demand customization of printed material. These processes can also serve for political and social purposes. The idea of printed books using QR codes to provide an individual with updates was one that I thought was interesting. The reading also discusses the relationship between print publications and digital publishing and how they expect both to intertwine and at some point become reliant on one another because many people may still want printed products over digital ones. Reflecting on the current relationship between print and digital, I realized that they both can depend on one another. Many people nowadays mostly interact with digital publications. Printed materials have also been converted into digital forms which has allowed more readers to have access to them. I now primarily interact with digital publications rather than print publications because it is so much easier and quicker to access, and I can access it from whenever I want. However, recently I found myself in a situation where I had a physical book in my hands and the digital version of that book in my possession as well. I ended up choosing to read the physically printed version of the book. I was surprised that I made this choice and that I ended up liking the fact that I was able to physically turn the pages and see my progression through the book. Reflecting on this makes me realize how strange it is that something as simple as the experience of reading a physical book no longer was something that I was accustomed to when just a few years ago, this was my normal. This reading made me really think about how much technology and digitalization has evolved and how it affects our experiences with printed publications.
            <br><br>
            Discussion Questions:<br>
            1. Do you think that print publications will one day stop being created as digitalization continues to evolve?<br>
            2. Do you think that print is evolving with digitalization?<br>
            <br>

            <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:21pt;">Week 8 - Bojana Coklyat & Shannon Finnegan - Selections from Alt-Text as Poetry Workbook</span><br><br>
            This week’s reading allowed me to better understand the importance of alt-text and how it fosters accessibility for individuals who are blind, have limited vision or have particular cognitive disabilities. These individuals may use screen readers when accessing digital content, and if alt-text is being used to describe its images, then it would be able to read it. Therefore, incorporating alt-text into the html for images helps make the internet more accessible. The reading mentioned that when writing alt-text, you should pay attention to the language you are using and aim for brevity. It also discusses how we can learn from poetry and incorporate its exploratory and playful components into alt-text. One should also keep the audience in mind when writing alt-text in order to convey a tone that would make sense for that audience. Before reading this week’s reading, I originally thought that alt-text was just a way to provide a short description of an image in the html.  This reading has allowed me to better understand how to approach writing alt-text now that I understand the reason behind the use of alt-text and how it grants accessibility to individuals who are blind or visually impaired.
            <br><br>
            Questions:<br>
            1. Should one try to create a balance between objectivity and subjectivity when writing alt-text?<br>
            2. How does one incorporate the exploratory and playfulness of poetry into alt-text without straying from its intended purpose?<br>
            <br>

            <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:21pt;">Week 9 - Ramsey Nasser - "A Personal Computer for Children of All Cultures" from Decolonising the Digital</span><br><br>
            The reading starts off by introducing us to the OLPC XO Laptop which is an affordable green & white computer that is given to children in developing countries so that they can interact with computers and learn from them. The OLPC’s mission is to “empower the world’s poorest children through education”. The interface of the device’s operating system and its documentation is available in a variety of different languages. However, they found that it is built on Python which uses English words and its UNIX terminal interacts with aspects of the POSIX standard which uses English names. This presents a problem if students from these developing countries want to take a closer look into their computers and come to find out that they can’t because they are confronted with a language unfamiliar to them. Something that I hadn’t realized before is that non-Latin text tends to be butchered by digital typesetting software because the assumptions that these softwares implement don’t necessarily adhere to non-Latin text, such as with Arabic which flows from right to left, is always in cursive, can have glyphs be positioned vertically. There have been times in which these systems have rendered Arabic backwards because graphic designers who do not speak Arabic have pasted Arabic text directly into their graphics packages that aren’t equipped for it. This example emphasizes the importance of accounting for all languages and cultures when designing in the digital world so that all individuals can feel included and prioritized. The reading also points out the importance of increasing the diversity within production and graphic design firms because this would allow these mistakes to be immediately caught. The reading also brings to the attention the invisible bias that exists within programming languages. Prominent programming languages use words and punctuation that are derived from the English language and its writing conventions. Therefore, in order for people to use these tools they have to at least have some knowledge of the English language. I also thought it was an interesting point that they mentioned that the binary representation of numbers in computers makes it appear as a neutral device but it is the way the non-numerical data is represented that makes it subjective. The reading also argues that assigning meaning to numbers allows for human bias to creep into the software.
            <br><br>
            Questions:<br>
            1. How can popular programming languages implement all of the languages across the world? Would that be feasible?<br>
            2. Do you agree or disagree with the point that creating a system that translates identifiers from English to another language should be rejected?<br>

            <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:21pt;">Week 10 - Ben Duvall - Selections from New Modernism(s)</span><br><br>
            The reading discusses how the choices a designer makes determines the connotations and the tone of their design. I thought it was interesting that they mentioned that the internet has developed a space for “infinitely multiplying surface and the hyperlinking of meaning” and that the digital is becoming the standard. In the reading, Ben Duvall proposed that the term hypermodernism represents the changes that post-digital art and design are undergoing. He states that since web’s content is derived from the language of graphic design then that means that graphic design trends set the stage for change. I also thought that it was interesting that he mentioned that playing with objects of design allows you to unveil networks of signifiers and associations that can then help you understand it. It was also surprising to learn about how cartoons were perceived through social and political lenses. The reading mentioned that cartoons expressed the life of the proletariat and showed the oppression of capital. Designers address these issues because they serve as both the creator of content and the deliverer. Ben Duvall first mentions Disney’s aesthetic of simplicity and reduction and then proceeds to mention that Disney serves as a symbol of the “globalizing forces of capital.” This shows how people can derive meaning from visual elements and how visuals can come to represent political notions like capitalism. Designers are also able to manipulate images in ways that can make symbols convey other meanings for viewers. It was interesting to see how fragments of Disney’s imagery in the posters (such as the gloved hands, the circular ears shape, and the style of Disney’s text) could make you as the viewer understand the work in a different light and could influence your perception of Disney.
            <br><br>
            Questions:<br>
            1. What does the author mean when referring to the “line quality” of Disney?<br>
            2. When design incorporates elements of a company’s imagery, such as the use of Disney’s imagery in the posters, do artists tend to get sued if the company disagrees with how their imagery was used in the design?<br>
            <br>

            <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:21pt;">Week 12 - Dot Tuer - Beyond the New Media Frame The Poetics of Absence in Vera Frenkel’s String Games</span><br><br>
            I thought it was interesting how Vera Frenkel brought to life her idea of “String Games”. Through incorporating “the screen,” Frenkel explores how one’s memory is shaped by the circulation and transmission of images in the electronic age. There were 10 participants in Montreal and Toronto and five chairs in each of the studios were occupied. Those in the five fixed chairs in each studio represented the fingers of two hands. Their actions made an imaginary string pass between them. They first did this with hands but then they proceeded to do the String Game out in the street with a big rope. Each player represented a finger and they would move their position to achieve a particular pattern. The reading also mentions that the physical movements were then replaced with words, names, sounds, gestures, etc. I thought it was interesting that the reading mentioned that Frenkel’s use of indeterminate outcomes and a set of protocols make her work be considered a part of the new media realm. The work was unseen for 30 years and it was only until Frenkel released a digitally edited 1 hour DVD version of it that its “historical significance and contemporary relevance began to be acknowledged”. This highlights the importance of the digital space and the documentation of works in society. The reading also mentions that String Game’s importance in new media was recognized in Canada but it tended to be excluded internationally when it came to new media’s history. The reading mentions that String Game has a poetics of absence to it because of the loss of presence that takes place when there is a substitution of a number, a word, a letter, a sound, etc. Frenkel also created the Body Missing website. Both String Games and the Body Missing Website showcase Frenkel’s pioneering use of technology.
            <br><br>
            Questions:<br>
            1. What do they mean by them replacing the physical movements in String Games with words, names, sounds, etc.? Did they just say a word instead of moving around?<br>
            2. Can you elaborate on the idea of String Games having a poetics of absence?<br>
            <br>

            <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:21pt;">Week 13 - Paul Soulellis - Performing the Feed</span><br><br>
            Soulellis views the act of posting as a gesture of making something public. In the reading, Paul Soulellis discusses the origin of the word “post” and how it comes from the idea of the physical wooden post, the post office, the poster, etc. This made me realize that it stems from the same idea of putting something out there. I can’t believe I never put two and two together before. In the reading, Soulellis questions whether Twitch streamers who go live for days at a time would be considered a form of publishing. Soulellis views this as less of a signal and more like noise. Soulellis also talks about live-streaming cameras and how they serve as a continuous transmission that interests people because others are also watching it, allowing them to witness a pure reaction together. It also allows people to be in different places while watching something at the same time. Soulellis also mentions that our tolerance for surveillance has increased. This statement stood out to me because I’ve noticed that people have become more willing to deal with surveillance and trade in some privacy if the convenience that that device/service brings them outweighs that lack of privacy. He also mentions that social media allows people to keep feeding each other the feeds. Soulellis suggests that the old paradigm of publishing had a pre-determined beginning and end. Now, the new paradigm of publishing can be seen through feeds which suggests a limitlessness and smooth flow because they tend to be never-ending scrolls. This endlessness of feeds is what ends up fueling people’s addiction to social media. Soulellis also talks about bots and how their ability to lose control or deceive fosters trust issues. Soulellis talks about Amazon Echo and I was shocked to find out that when they created an Amazon Echo account they were able to access all of the transcripts of the conversations they had with the device. I also thought it was interesting how Soulellis views the act of archiving as a form of resistance to something that flows because it fixes it in space.
            <br><br>
            Questions:<br>
            1. Do you agree with the idea that a feed can feel like a texture?<br>
            2. Do you consider a leak to be an art form?<br>
            <br>

            <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:21pt;">Week 14 - Neta Bomani & Sabii Borno - Beyond Dark Matter from Logic Issue 15 Beacons</span><br><br>
            I thought the storytelling in “Beyond Dark Matter” was interesting. In the reading, it would occasionally describe technical terms in an easy to understand manner. It did so with words and phrases like pixels, synchronous communication, the master and slave relationship in technology, etc. Through Gem’s journey in the computer, we hear about events in history. While on the train, she heard about different people involved in the Civil Right Movement and those who were assassinated. In “the Beyond,” Gem is reminded of Ms. Johnson and her community who are always there for her. The reading also mentions that computers were built on older forms of technology and that they were built to resemble elements of our world. The reading also mentions that computers have made social change more possible because it enables information to spread online and because it allows people to connect with one another. Computers can also influence how we view and understand ourselves and society, but it's important to note that computers don’t have to define us and what we are capable of. The reading also touches on how software and computers can exhibit a form of control and isolation on users. This made me reflect on the juxtaposition between isolation and connectivity that technology creates as people spend more time on devices which creates this isolation from others but at the same time they may feel connected to others around the world who are also interacting with the digital world and exploring social media. The reading ends off by stressing the importance of community and working together to make change in the world possible. I liked how the story ended with her reuniting with her community and helping make change happen.
            <br><br>
            Discussion Questions:<br>
            1. Do you think Gem made the right choice cancelling her computer’s update when it was at 99%?<br>
            2. Do you perceive computers as a form of control and isolation?<br>
            <br>

            <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:21pt;">Week 15 - Boris Groys - Art on the Internet</span><br><br>
            In “Art on the Internet,” Boris Groys discusses how people perceive art and literature on the internet. Groys argues that the internet is much more liberating in comparison to museums and traditional publishing houses since the internet is not as selective. I thought it was interesting when Groys mentions that the internet serving as a medium of production and distribution of art and literature has led to the defictionalization of art and literature. Groys goes on to argue that the internet doesn’t let people fully immerse themselves in the fictional world in comparison to traditional institutions and that the internet functions as a nonfictional character because it has a “reference point in offline reality”. However, I disagree with Groys because I do believe that people are still able to immerse themselves in the fictional world while using the internet. For instance, when reading fictional literature while on my computer or while using the internet, I feel like I am still able to immerse myself in the story and into that fictional world. I think that having been accustomed to reading and interacting with the internet on a daily basis has helped facilitate this process, and it has allowed me to fully immerse myself in a story’s fictional world just as much as I would if I were to read it in a physical book. I also thought it was interesting to learn about Groys perspective and how he believes that on the internet it's hard to ignore the framing because the individuals themselves are creating it when they click onto something, such as specialized websites or art blogs. Groys also states that there is no art or literature on the internet because the internet just has information about art and literature. However, I feel like art, especially, can exist by itself on the internet without it having information about that art alongside it. I agree with Groys when he mentions that the internet has made the art of authors more accessible and it has facilitated the globalization of authors. The internet makes literature and art more accessible because it grants people across the world the opportunity to interact with it.
            <br><br>
            Discussion Questions:<br>
            1. Do you agree or disagree with the argument that the internet has led to defictionalization?<br>
